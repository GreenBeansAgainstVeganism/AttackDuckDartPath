<h1 align="center">AttackDuck's Dart Path</h1>

<h3 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/doombubbles/paths-plus-plus">THIS MOD REQUIRES PATHS++</a></h3>

This mod adds a fourth upgrade path to the Dart Monkey.

Below you'll find a list of upgrades, as well as some notes about balance and design. This is a mod so don't expect perfect balance, but I am a game design nerd so I try to put a lot of thought into my design choices.

<h2>Uprade Info:</h2>

<h3>Tier 1: Accurate Darts</h3>

$95

<h4>Description:</h4>

Darts fly further and curve slightly towards their target.

<h4>Detailed notes:</h4>

- Projectiles gain a weak seeking behavior
- Projectiles get additional lifespan and speed

Darts not connecting with fast targets / not maxxing out their pierce because of bad angles is a massive pain early game, so I thought I'd give Dart Monkey some weak seeking abilities to make that less of a pain. The seeking is much weaker than other towers with seeking projectiles and doesn't in any way guarantee your darts will hit all the bloons, but that's what you get for a $95 upgrade. It does, however, synergize nicely with the other 3 paths' later upgrades, especially spike-o-pult.

<h3>Tier 2: Bullseye</h3>

$155

<h4>Description:</h4>

The first bloon each dart makes contact with takes damage twice.

<h4>Detailed notes:</h4>

- Deals a second hit of damage to the first bloon the projectile collides with, dealing the same amount of damage as the original projectile.

This upgrade has the effect of doubling the tower's single-target dps while not impacting their overall dps too much in order to be balanced, leaning into this path's theme of very narrow-focused dps. It makes for a fairly decent early game upgrade, which I felt was deserved since vanilla dart monkey's upgrades all kind of suck until you get to at least tier 3.

<h3>Tier 3: Sling Shot</h3>

$390

<h4>Description:</h4>

Dart Monkey abandons their darts in favor of a superior weapon. Attacks over obstacles and at significantly increased distance and attack rate.

<h4>Detailed notes:</h4>

- Changes the attack to a splash projectile, similar to bomb shooter
- Massively increased range (twice the base range)
- Increased pierce (5 base, 7 with sharp darts, 9 with razor sharp darts)
- Increased attack rate
- Allows attacking over map obstacles

This upgrade is designed to be somewhat weaker than triple darts or crossbow which I feel are really strong early game towers, but in return it is much more versatile. I intended it to be a go-to option for early game on more advanced maps with limited placement options or lots of obstacles, such as Dark Dungeon, as there are no other cheap towers that can see over obstacles and have enough range for that capability to actually matter. The damage radius of the pebbles is also quite small compared to bombs or other splash attacks, so this tower does best against tightly clustered bloons.

<h3>Tier 4: Bloon Hunter</h3>

$2400

<h4>Description:</h4>

Hurls bolases which grapple and weaken smaller bloons/Moabs, slowing them and causing them to take double damage from all sources for a brief period.

<h4>Detailed notes:</h4>

- Pierce increased to 12 base, 16 with sharp darts and 20 with razor sharp darts
- Bolases apply a 50% slow to bloons and a 25% slow to Moabs and double all incoming damage.
- Effect lasts 3 seconds and does not apply to Ddts or larger blimps.
- Projectile splash radius increased slightly (more with razor sharp darts)
- Range increased slightly because why not

There are no towers in the vanilla game which apply a multiplicative damage buff, which I think is a shame. It's understandable though, as this is a difficult mechanic to balance as it scales with the power of the rest of your defense. So, to balance this 4th tier, it only affects up to Moabs, and beyond that, Bloon Hunter has fairly limited pierce, so one of them will not be able to consistently debuff all incoming bloons on its own. Regardless, it's an invaluable addition to a mid-game defense and a cheap support option for ceramic cleanup later on in the game.

<h3>Tier 5: Moab Wrangler</h3>

$15600

<h4>Description:</h4>

Throws multiple bolases at once and excels at trapping large swathes of bloons. Moab Snare Ability: Lays a trap which, when triggered, traps even the biggest bloons around it, slowing them and tripling all damage dealt to them for a short window of time.

<h4>Detailed notes:</h4>

- Monkey now attacks 3x as fast and throws two bolases at once with some randomness in the angles
- Ability places a snare object which deals 50 damage to everything in a small radius when a bloon touches it
- Snare also applies a 50% slow to all bloon types (Bads and Bosses not slowed) and triples all incoming damage
- Snare effect lasts for 5 seconds
- Ability takes 30 seconds to recharge
- Ability has a target location which can be selected, similar to Gwen's cocktail or Obyn's wall of trees
- Range increased slightly because why not

This upgrade allows Dart Monkey to finally claim its rightful place as the tower with the cheapest tier 5! On its own, its damage output is slightly underwhelming and it struggles against rounds that even another cheap tier 5 like Elite Defender would demolish. However, the increased attack rate and spread of its bolases serves to greatly improve its ability to debuff many bloons at once, and the ability gives it a unique niche which pairs nicely with ability towers that have short bursts of high damage. This upgrade is, admittedly, a little unbalanced for freeplay and bosses since using the ability as often as possible effectively increases your total single-target dps by 33%, but personally I feel like it adds more to the gameplay than it detracts.
